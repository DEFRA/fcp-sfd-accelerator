            **Your PR is now approved üéâ**  
            Before merging, be sure to include `#patch` or `#major` in your commit message if merging either a patch or major version.  
            This will ensure CDP deploys the correct version.  
            If merging a minor version, nothing needs to be done as these are automatically handled and deployed by CDP.  
            Full details can be found in the [CDP documentation](https://portal.cdp-int.defra.cloud/documentation/how-to/microservices.md?q=bump%20a%20either%20the%20major%20or%20patch%20version%2C%20push%20a%20commit%20with#versioning-your-microservice).  
            Thank you. üëç
